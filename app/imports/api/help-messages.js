  organizationName: 'You can choose to set up all your users within a single organization in Plio, or create different Plio organizations for different business units.

To save time and effort, you can set simpler workflows for your less critical Nonconformities and Risks. Plio always uses a 3-step workflow process for managing Potential Gains. Workflows can be further simplified by ticking the “Simplified completion of own actions” box. When this box is ticked, if an owner of a Nonconformity (or Potential Gain) has created an action for themselves and then clicked the complete button for that action, it won’t be returned to that same person to verify completion. If you do need specific recording of each and every verification step in Plio, then untick this box.',
